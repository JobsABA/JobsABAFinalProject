                    <b>Minimizing Credit Card Fraud</b>
                    <p>Jobs In ABA is committed to minimizing fraudulent credit card transactions. We have implemented a system of internal controls and verification to confirm the validity of credit card transactions.</p>
                    <p>Jobs In ABA takes credit card information seriously:<br />All computer data is encrypted per current banking standards, and NO complete credit card information is ever stored in any of our computer systems. We can only access the last four digits of any credit card stored in our computer systems. Any retained paperwork and ‘orders in process’ containing credit card information are kept in locked file cabinets until discarded. ANY discarded paperwork containing credit card information is shredded. We are subject to compliance with the credit card operation policies of our accepted credit cards – Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express card authorization for monthly and yearly recurring billing is obtained and confirmed at the time of subscription.</p>

                    <b>Communications Decency Act</b>
                    <p>Although our Code of Conduct prohibits users from posting defamatory material, we cannot ensure that it does not occur due to our limited editorial resources. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, we are not liable for defamatory material published by third parties (such as our users) on our website.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you report any alleged defamation by third parties to us with full details of who you are and how the material is defamatory and, if we agree it is defamatory, we may remove it. However, do not attempt to sue us, whether or not we remove such material, as we are not liable due to the Communications Decency Act and will attempt to recover any attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements from you that are incurred as a result of defending against such an unfounded lawsuit.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, due to the SPEECH Act 2010, you cannot attempt to sue us in another country for defamation and then attempt to domesticate the judgment in the United States to enforce it.</p>
                    <p>If it is unclear to us whether something is defamatory or not, regardless of whether it is a legal or factual lack of clarity, we will likely not remove the complained-about content. However, we may remove it in such instances if you produce for us a court order or declaration from within the United States declaring the specific content complained about to be unlawful.</p>
                    <p>Note that any actions we take to policy defamatory material on our website are strictly voluntary, and we reserve all rights under the Communications Decency Act, as well as any other statutory, constitutional, or common law defenses.</p>
                    <p>If you believe that Jobs In ABA, LLC, rather than a third party, has posted defamatory material, please contact us with full details at <a href="mailto:terms@jobsinaba.com">terms@jobsinaba.com</a> so that we can mitigate any alleged loss as soon as possible.</p>

                    <b>Forum of Dispute</b>
                    <p>You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be heard solely by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of California. Specifically, you agree that any disputes shall be heard, where eligible, solely within the Civil Court of the City of Los Angeles – Small Claims Part (“Small Claims Court”).</p>
                    <p>You agree that where the amount you would otherwise claim exceeds the monetary jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court, which at the time of the publication of this Agreement is up to $5,000, you will waive your right to collect any damages in excess of the monetary jurisdiction and instead only sue us for the maximum amount of $5,000.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, if you have multiple causes of action, you agree that if your claim would be eligible to be heard by the Small Claims Court, except that one or more of the causes of action or other rights to collect damages would not be eligible for the Small Claims Court to hear, you will waive your right to claim damages for any of the ineligible claims and instead still bring the dispute in the Small Claims Court for only the claim or claims over which the Small Claims Court has jurisdiction to hear.</p>
                    <p>Likewise, if you would otherwise have any non-monetary remedies available to you outside of the Small Claims Court, such as the right to an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief, you agree that you will waive your right to obtain such relief against us. If you bring a dispute in a manner other than in accordance with this section, you agree that we may move to have it dismissed, and that you will be responsible for our reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and disbursements in doing so.</p>
                    <p>You agree that the prevailing party in any dispute will be entitled to claim from the unsuccessful party the entire amount of the prevailing party’s reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs, and disbursements in relation to the dispute.</p>

                        <ul style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
                            <li>Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).</li>
                            <li>You authorize us to store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your service (e.g. subscriptions) and to facilitate easy payment for new services.</li>
                            <li>You must pay us for applicable fees and taxes unless you cancel your service, in which case you agree to still pay these fees through the end of the applicable subscription period. </li>
                            <li>Taxes are calculated based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.</li>

                    <p>Jobs In ABA is committed to minimizing fraudulent credit card transactions. We have implemented a system of internal controls and verification to confirm the validity of credit card transactions.</p>
                    <p>
                        Jobs In ABA takes credit card information seriously:<br />
                        All compute data is encrypted per current banking standards, and NO complete credit card information is ever stored in any of our computer systems. We can only access the last four digits of any credit card stored in our computer systems. Any retained paperwork and ‘orders in process’ containing credit card information are kept in locked file cabinets until discarded. ANY discarded paperwork containing credit card information is shredded. We are subject to compliance with the credit card operation policies of our accepted credit cards – Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express card authorization for monthly and yearly recurring billing is obtained and confirmed at the time of subscription.
